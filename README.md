# Physics-Final

This is the Physics-based Simulation final coursework. The project involves creating a scene with spheres that bounce on the floor, on invisible walls and between each other.
The code uses the Sweep and Prune algorithm as a Collision Detection algorithm.

The source code is in the *04_rigid_body_framework*. I had to leave the rest of the projects because otherwise I would get build errors.

## Commands
W - Go forward <br />
A - Go left <br />
S - Go back <br />
D - Go right <br />
Scrolling the mouse wheel changes the FOV. <br />
Spacebar - Spawn a random sphere in a random position.
