# Physics-Final

This is the Physics-based Simulation final coursework. The project involves creating a scene with spheres that bounce on the floor, on invisible walls and between each other.
The code uses the Sweep and Prune algorithm as a Collision Detection algorithm.

## Commands
W - Go forward
A - Go left
S - Go back
D - Go right
Scrolling the mouse wheel changes the FOV.
Spacebar - Spawn a random sphere in a random position.
